# BlackJack-assembly

BlackJack-assembly is the BlackJack game implemented by only using Assembly language.
It runs in the command window.
The player has to choose the corresponding option to start the game, then the Dealer's drawn cards along with the score are displayed. After that, the player's first card is shown.
The player has the choice to either draw a new card or stand.
After the player decides to stand, the Dealer will automatically draw cards according to the BlackJack set of rules. The one with the highest score that's lower or equal to 21 is the winner. If any of the sides draws cards and the score exceeds 21, the other side wins and the BUST message is displayed, along with the side that went bust.
